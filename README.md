# AOJ
This repository includes the example answers of problems in AOJ (http://judge.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/).

The examples are for those who join the group practicing programming contest in Ochanomizu Uni.

Since I, yuzumikan15, am also a very beginner of programming contestant, please tell me if there is better answer (Giving me pull requests is also very very welcome!).
